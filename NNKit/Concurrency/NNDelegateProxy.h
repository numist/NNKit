/*!
 * @class NNDelegateProxy
 *
 * @discussion
 * A proxy object ensuring that messages to the delegate are dispatched on the
 * main thread.
 *
 * Messages declared as oneway void are dispatched asynchronously, messages that
 * are optional are dispatched against nil if the delegate does not implement them.
 * Messages that are optional and non-void are a bad idea and you shouldn't use them.

 * @param block
 * The block to be invoked on the main queue.
 * The result of passing <code>NULL</code> in this parameter is undefined.
 * Which is to say it will probably crash.

 *
 * @discussion
 * When waiting for asynchronous jobs in a dispatch group that may block on the
 * current thread, this function yields the runloop and then returns the group
 * state.
 *
 * @param group
 * The group for which the caller is waiting.
 *
 * @result
 * <code>YES</code> if the group has no members, <code>NO</code> otherwise.

     *   * invalidate may be called before the refCount hits zero, in which case the object should survive until its natural death.
     *   * invalidate may be called at refCount zero, in which case the object should survive until the end of the current runloop.
     * To satisfy both of these constraints, retain/release messages are forwarded to super and one extra retain is made (here) balanced by an autorelease in -invalidate to keep the object alive while it is still valid/invalidating.
     * Calling dealloc directly is an error and is not supported.

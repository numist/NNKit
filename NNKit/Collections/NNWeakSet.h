/*!
 * @class NNMutableWeakSet
 *
 * @abstract
 * Provides a set-type collection that references its members weakly.
 *
 * @discussion
 * NNWeakSet implements the same API as NSMutableSet, but holds weak
 * references to its members.
 *
 * No compaction is required, members are automatically removed when they are
 * deallocated.
 *
 * This collection type may be slower than NSHashTable, but it also has
 * fewer bugs.

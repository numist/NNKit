NNKit
=====

This library represents a collection of well-tested, robust, occasionally idiotic, but always well-meaning widgets for the Objective-C developer.

At the moment it is a poorly-documented collection of code samples for my [NSMeetup talk](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup/events/136648202/) as well as a shared repository of solutions to common problems for [Switch](https://github.com/numist/Switch) and tmbo, the latter being a sort of promise to keep on adding, testing, and documenting the framework.

The framework is broken up by purpose, the most entertaining of which are likely [Swizzling](https://github.com/numist/NNKit/tree/master/NNKit/Swizzling) and [Hacks](https://github.com/numist/NNKit/tree/master/NNKit/Hacks).
